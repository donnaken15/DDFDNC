## Decentralized Distributive Free Domain Name Configuration

A system I thought of for maybe a few months now, which is dependent on the hosts file on computers, where it can basically be used as your own custom technical DNS config

What I'm thinking is a file that is like hosts and that can be written and deleted from the hosts file

I don't know exactly how to explain it but it's definitely set up in mind
